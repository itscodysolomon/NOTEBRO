# NOTE BRO

  

NOTE BRO is a simple notepad app with the focus being quick access and organization of notes.

I had a bad habit of having 10,000 text edit pads open at all times.

I built this project to fix that habit and have fun messing with Vue and Electron.
It also uses the Vuetify library.

  

I've only had time to set it up for Mac OS at this point.

  

See the *install* folder for the latest version. Hope you like it!
